# Preface

Welcome to Applied Time Series Analysis with `R`.


## About This Book

This book is intended as a support for the course of 463 (Applied Time Series). It contains an overview of the basic procedures to adequately approach a time series analysis with insight to more advanced analysis of time series. It firstly introduces the basic concepts and theory to appropriately use the applied tools that are presented in the second (and main) part of the book. In the latter part the reader will learn how to use descriptive analysis to identify the important characteristics of a time serues and then employ modelling and inference techniques (made available through R funtions) that allow to describe a time series and make predictions. The last part of the book will give introductory notions on more advanced analysis of time series where the reader will achieve a basic understanding of the tools available to anayse more complex characteristic of time series. 

This document is under active development and as a result is likely to contains
many errors. As Montesquieu puts it:
