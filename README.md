"An Introduction to Time Series Analysis" is a text developed to give readers a general overview of the main aspects that characterise time series and the most common tools used for their analysis. 

The book gives an overview of the practical settings in which time series analysis is of primary importance. Through the use of real-life examples and simulations, the book then proceeds to introducing the more formal definitions that are necessary to understand the problems behind time series analysis and the solutions that are available to those who are interested in performing such an analysis.

Starting from the definition of the basic time series models, the book provides the theoretical bases to understand the most important properties of time series among which the concept of stationarity and the different forms through which it is possible to characterise the main features of these processes.

Once the basic properties and characteristics are stated, the book proceeds to delivering an overview of the methods used to estimate the quantities of interest. From the empirical autocovariance functions to the MLE for time series model estimation, the reader will be lead through the technical details underlying the different estimators which allow them to better understand and interpret the outputs of an estimation procedure. Using the R software, the book will therefore allow the reader to carry out the main analyses to correctly address the complex features of time series.

Finally, a quick overview of more advanced topics in time series analysis is provided thereby covering heteroskedastic time series (GARCH), state-space models and, possibly, multivariate time series. The latter topics are also extremely common in the analysis of real-life time series analysis.
