In this chapter we will discuss and formalize how knowledge about $X_{t-1}$ (or
more generally about all the information from the past, $\Omega_t$) can provide 
us with some information about the properties of $X_t$. In particular, we will 
consider the correlation (or covariance) of $X_t$ at different times such 
as $\text{corr} \left(X_t, X_{t+h}\right)$. This "form" of correlation (covariance) is
called the *autocorrelation* (*autocovariance*) and is a very useful tool in
time series analysis. However, if we do not assume that a time series is 
characterized by a certain form of "stability", it would be rather difficult 
to estimate $\text{corr} \left(X_t, X_{t+h}\right)$ as this quantity would depend on 
both $t$ and $h$ leading to more parameters to estimate than observations 
available. Therefore, the concept of *stationarity* is convenient in this
context as it allows (among other things) to assume that

\[\text{corr} \left(X_t, X_{t+h}\right) = \text{corr} \left(X_{t+j}, X_{t+h+j}\right), \;\;\; \text{for all $j$},\]

implying that the autocorrelation (or autocovariance) is only a function of the
lag between observations, rather than time itself. These first of these two concepts (i.e. 
autocorrelation and stationarity) will be discussed in this chapter while stationarity will be discussed in the following one. Before 
moving on, it is helpful to remember that correlation (or autocorrelation) is
only appropriate to measure a very specific kind of dependence, i.e. the linear
dependence. There are many other forms of dependence as illustrated in the
bottom panels of the graph below, which all have a (true) zero correlation:

```{r correxample, cache = TRUE, echo = FALSE, fig.cap="Different forms of dependence and their Pearson's r values", fig.align = 'center'}
knitr::include_graphics("images/corr_example.png")
```

Several other metrics have been introduced in the literature to assess the
degree of "dependence" of two random variables, however this goes beyond the
material discussed in this chapter.

 
## The Autocorrelation and Autocovariance Functions 

```{definition, label="acvf"}
The *autocovariance function* of a series $(X_t)$ is defined as 

\[{\gamma_x}\left( {t,t+h} \right) \equiv \text{cov} \left( {{X_t},{X_{t+h}}} \right),\]
```

where the definition of covariance is given by:
  
  \[
    \text{cov} \left( {{X_t},{X_{t+h}}} \right) \equiv \mathbb{E}\left[ {{X_t}{X_{t+h}}} \right] - \mathbb{E}\left[ {{X_t}} \right]\mathbb{E}\left[ {{X_{t+h}}} \right].
    \]

Similarly, the above expectations are defined to be:
  
  \[\begin{aligned}
     \mathbb{E}\left[ {{X_t}} \right] &\equiv \int\limits_{ - \infty }^\infty  {x \cdot {f_t}\left( x \right)dx},  \\
     \mathbb{E}\left[ {{X_t}{X_{t+h}}} \right] &\equiv \int\limits_{ - \infty }^\infty  {\int\limits_{ - \infty }^\infty  {{x_1}{x_2} \cdot f_{t,t+h}\left( {{x_1},{x_2}} \right)d{x_1}d{x_2}} } ,
     \end{aligned} \]

where ${f_t}\left( x \right)$ and $f_{t,t+h}\left( {{x_1},{x_2}} \right)$ denote,
respectively, the density of $X_t$ and the joint density of the 
pair $(X_t, X_{t+h})$. For the notation, it should be clear that $X_t$ is assumed to be a continous random variable. Since we generally consider stochastic processes with
constant zero mean, we often have

\[{\gamma_x}\left( {t,t+h} \right) = \mathbb{E}\left[X_t X_{t+h} \right]. \]

In addition, we normally drop the subscript referring to the time
series (i.e. $x$ in this case) if it is clear from the context which time
series the autocovariance refers to. For example, we generally 
use ${\gamma}\left( {t,t+h} \right)$ instead
of ${\gamma_x}\left( {t,t+h} \right)$. Moreover, the notation is even further
simplified when the covariance of $X_t$ and $X_{t+h}$ is the same as that
of $X_{t+j}$ and $X_{t+h+j}$ (for all $j$), i.e. the covariance depends only 
on the time between observations and not on the specific time $t$. This is an 
important property called *stationarity*, which will be discussed in the next
section. In this case, we simply use to following notation:

  \[\gamma \left( {h} \right) = \text{cov} \left( X_t , X_{t+h} \right). \]

This notation will generally be used throughout the text and implies 
certain properties (i.e. stationarity) on the process $(X_t)$. 
Several remarks can be made on the autocovariance:
  
  1. The autocovariance function is *symmetric*. 
That is, ${\gamma}\left( {h} \right) = {\gamma}\left( -h \right)$ 
  since $\text{cov} \left( {{X_t},{X_{t+h}}} \right) = \text{cov} \left( X_{t+h},X_{t} \right)$.
2. The autocovariance function "contains" the variance of the process 
as $\text{var} \left( X_{t} \right) = {\gamma}\left( 0 \right)$.
3. We have that $|\gamma(h)| \leq \gamma(0)$ for all $h$. The proof of this 
inequality is direct and follows from the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality, i.e.
\[ \begin{aligned}
  \left(|\gamma(h)| \right)^2 &= \gamma(h)^2 = \left(\mathbb{E}\left[\left(X_t - \mathbb{E}[X_t] \right)\left(X_{t+h} - \mathbb{E}[X_{t+h}] \right)\right]\right)^2\\
  &\leq \mathbb{E}\left[\left(X_t - \mathbb{E}[X_t] \right)^2 \right] \mathbb{E}\left[\left(X_{t+h} - \mathbb{E}[X_{t+h}] \right)^2 \right] =  \gamma(0)^2. 
  \end{aligned}
  \] 
4. Just as any covariance, ${\gamma}\left( {h} \right)$ is "scale dependent"
since ${\gamma}\left( {h} \right) \in \mathbb{R}$, 
or $-\infty \le {\gamma}\left( {h} \right) \le +\infty$. We therefore have:
  - if $\left| {\gamma}\left( {h} \right) \right|$ is "close" to zero, 
then $X_t$ and $X_{t+h}$ are "weakly" (linearly) dependent;
- if $\left| {\gamma}\left( {h} \right) \right|$ is "far" from zero, 
then the two random variable present a "strong" (linear) dependence. 
However it is generally difficult to asses what "close" and "far" from 
zero means in this case. 
5. ${\gamma}\left( {h} \right)=0$ does not imply that $X_t$ and $X_{t+h}$ are 
independent but simply $X_t$ and $X_{t+h}$ are uncorrelated. 
The independence is only implied by ${\gamma}\left( {h} \right)=0$ in
the jointly Gaussian case.

As hinted in the introduction, an important related statistic is the correlation
of $X_t$ with $X_{t+h}$ or *autocorrelation*, which is defined as

$$\rho \left(  h \right) = \text{corr}\left( {{X_t},{X_{t + h}}} \right) = \frac{{\text{cov}\left( {{X_t},{X_{t + h}}} \right)}}{{{\sigma _{{X_t}}}{\sigma _{{X_{t + h}}}}}} = \frac{\gamma(h) }{\gamma(0)}.$$
  
Similarly to $\gamma(h)$, it is important to note that the above notation 
implies that the autocorrelation function is only a function of the 
lag $h$ between observations. Thus, autocovariances and autocorrelations are one
possible way to describe the joint distribution of a time series. Indeed, the 
correlation of $X_t$ with $X_{t+1}$ is an obvious measure of how *persistent* a
time series is. 

Remember that just as with any correlation:
  
1. $\rho \left( h \right)$ is "scale free" so it is much easier to interpret 
than $\gamma(h)$.
2. $|\rho \left( h \right)| \leq 1$ since $|\gamma(h)| \leq \gamma(0)$.
3. **Causation and correlation are two very different things!**
  
### A Fundamental Representation
  
Autocovariances and autocorrelations also turn out to be very useful tools as
they are one of the *fundamental representations* of time series. Indeed, if we
consider a zero mean normally distributed process, it is clear that its joint
distribution is fully characterized by the 
autocovariances $\mathbb{E}[X_t X_{t+h}]$ (since the joint probability density
                                           only depends of these covariances). Once we know the autocovariances we
know *everything* there is to know about the process and therefore:
  
*if two processes have the same autocovariance function, then they are the 
same process.*
  
### Admissible Autocorrelation Functions `r emo::ji("scream")`
  
Since the autocorrelation is related to a fundamental representation of time
series, it implies that one might be able to define a stochastic process by 
picking a set of autocorrelation values (assuming for example that $\text{var}(X_t) = 1$). 
However, it turns out that not every collection of
numbers, say $\{\rho_1, \rho_2, ...\}$, can represent the autocorrelation of a
process. Indeed, two conditions are required to ensure the validity of an
autocorrelation sequence:
  
1. $\operatorname{max}_j \; | \rho_j| \leq 1$.
2. $\text{var} \left[\sum_{j = 0}^\infty \alpha_j X_{t-j} \right] \geq 0 \;$ for all $\{\alpha_0, \alpha_1, ...\}$.

The first condition is obvious and simply reflects the fact 
that $|\rho \left( h \right)| \leq 1$ but the second is far more difficult to
verify. To further our understanding of the latter we let $\alpha_j = 0$ for $j > 1$,
then condition two implies that

\[\text{var} \left[ \alpha_0 X_{t} + \alpha_1 X_{t-1}  \right] = \gamma_0 \begin{bmatrix}
   \alpha_0 & \alpha_1
   \end{bmatrix}   \begin{bmatrix}
   1 & \rho_1\\
   \rho_1 & 1
   \end{bmatrix} \begin{bmatrix}
   \alpha_0 \\
   \alpha_1
   \end{bmatrix} \geq 0. \]

Thus, the matrix 

\[ \boldsymbol{A}_1 = \begin{bmatrix}
  1 & \rho_1\\
  \rho_1 & 1
  \end{bmatrix} \]

must be positive semi-definite. Taking the determinant we have 

\[\operatorname{det} \left(\boldsymbol{A}_1\right) = 1 - \rho_1^2 \]

implying that the condition $|\rho_1| \leq 1$ must be respected. 
Now, let $\alpha_j = 0$ for $j > 2$, then we must verify that:
  
  \[\text{var} \left[ \alpha_0 X_{t} + \alpha_1 X_{t-1}  + \alpha_2 X_{t-2} \right] = \gamma_0 \begin{bmatrix}
     \alpha_0 & \alpha_1 &\alpha_2
     \end{bmatrix}   \begin{bmatrix}
     1 & \rho_1 & \rho_2\\
     \rho_1 & 1 & \rho_1 \\
     \rho_2 & \rho_1 & 1
     \end{bmatrix} \begin{bmatrix}
     \alpha_0 \\
     \alpha_1 \\
     \alpha_2
     \end{bmatrix} \geq 0. \]

Again, this implies that the matrix

\[ \boldsymbol{A}_2 = \begin{bmatrix}
  1 & \rho_1 & \rho_2\\
  \rho_1 & 1 & \rho_1 \\
  \rho_2 & \rho_1 & 1
  \end{bmatrix} \]

must be positive semi-definite and it is easy to verify that

\[\operatorname{det} \left(\boldsymbol{A}_2\right) = \left(1 - \rho_2 \right)\left(- 2 \rho_1^2 + \rho_2 + 1\right). \]

Thus, this implies that 

\[\begin{aligned} &- 2 \rho_1^2 + \rho_2 + 1 \geq 0 \Rightarrow 1 \geq \rho_2 \geq 2 \rho_1^2 - 1 \\
   &\Rightarrow 1 - \rho_1^2 \geq \rho_2 - \rho_1^2 \geq -(1 - \rho_1^2)\\
   &\Rightarrow 1 \geq \frac{\rho_2 - \rho_1^2 }{1 - \rho_1^2} \geq -1.
   \end{aligned}\]

Therefore, $\rho_1$ and $\rho_2$ must lie in a parabolic shaped region defined
by the above inequalities as illustrated in Figure \@ref(fig:admissibility).

```{r admissibility, cache = TRUE, echo = FALSE, fig.cap = "Admissible autocorrelation functions", fig.align='center', fig.height = 5, fig.width = 7}
plot(NA, xlim = c(-1.1,1.1), ylim = c(-1.1,1.1), xlab = expression(rho[1]),
     ylab = expression(rho[2]), cex.lab = 1.5)
grid()

# Adding boundary of constraint |rho_1| < 1
abline(v = c(-1,1), lty = 2, col = "darkgrey")

# Adding boundary of constraint |rho_2| < 1
abline(h = c(-1,1), lty = 2, col = "darkgrey")

# Adding boundary of non-linear constraint
rho1 = seq(from = -1, to = 1, length.out = 10^3)
rho2 = (rho1^2 - 1) + rho1^2 
lines(rho1, rho2, lty = 2, col = "darkgrey")

# Adding admissible region

        border = NA, col= rgb(0,0,1, alpha = 0.1))

# Adding text
text(0,0, c("Admissible Region"))
```

From our derivation, it is clear that the restrictions on the autocorrelation are
very complicated, thereby justifying the need for other forms of fundamental 
representation which we will explore later in this text. Before moving on to
the estimation of the autocorrelation and autocovariance functions, we must 
first discuss the stationarity of $(X_t)$, which will provide a convenient 
framework in which $\gamma(h)$ and $\rho(h)$ can be used (rather that $\gamma(t,t+h)$ 
for example) and (easily) estimated.
  
## Estimation of Moments
  
In this section, we discuss how moments and related quantities of stationary
process can be estimated. Informally speaking, the use of "averages" is 
meaningful for such processes suggesting that classical moments estimators can
be employed. Indeed, suppose that one is interested in 
estimating $\alpha \equiv \mathbb{E}[m (X_t)]$, where $m(\cdot)$ is a known
function of $X_t$. If $X_t$ is a strongly stationary process, we have
  
\[\alpha = \int m(x) \, f(x) dx\]
  
where $f(x)$ denotes the density of $X_t, \; \forall t$. Replacing $f(x)$ by
$f_n(x)$, the empirical density, we obtain the following estimator
  
\[\hat{\alpha} = \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i = 1}^n m\left(x_i\right).\]
  
In the next subsection, we examine how this simple idea can be used to estimate
the mean, autocovariance and autocorrelation functions. Moreover, we discuss
some of the properties of these estimators.
  
  
### Estimation of the Mean Function
  
If a time series is stationary, the mean function is constant and a possible
estimator of this quantity is, as discussed above, given by
  
\[\bar{X} = {\frac{1}{n}\sum\limits_{t = 1}^n {{X_t}} }.\]
  
Naturally, the $k$-th moment, say $\beta_k \equiv \mathbb{E}[X_t^k]$ can be
estimated by
  
\[\hat{\beta}_k = {\frac{1}{n}\sum\limits_{t = 1}^n {{X_t^k}} }, \;\; k \in \left\{x \in \mathbb{N} : \, 0 < x < \infty  \right\}.\]
  
The variance of such an estimator can be derived as follows:
    
\begin{equation}
  \begin{aligned}
  \text{var} \left( \hat{\beta}_k \right) &= \text{var} \left( {\frac{1}{n}\sum\limits_{t = 1}^n {{X_t^k}} } \right)  \\
  &= \frac{1}{{{n^2}}}\text{var} \left( {{{\left[ {\begin{array}{*{20}{c}}
    1& \cdots &1
    \end{array}} \right]}_{1 \times n}}{{\left[ {\begin{array}{*{20}{c}}
      {{X_1^k}} \\
      \vdots  \\
      {{X_n^k}}
      \end{array}} \right]}_{n \times 1}}} \right)  \\
  &= \frac{1}{{{n^2}}}{\left[ {\begin{array}{*{20}{c}}
    1& \cdots &1
    \end{array}} \right]_{1 \times n}} \, \boldsymbol{\Sigma}(k) \, {\left[ {\begin{array}{*{20}{c}}
      1 \\
      \vdots  \\
      1
      \end{array}} \right]_{n \times 1}}, 
  \end{aligned}
  (\#eq:chap2VarMoment)
\end{equation}
    
where $\boldsymbol{\Sigma}(k) \in \mathbb{R}^{n \times n}$ and its $i$-th, $j$-th
element is given by
    
\[ \left(\boldsymbol{\Sigma}(k)\right)_{i,j} = \text{cov} \left(X_i^k, X_j^k\right).\]
    
In the case $k = 1$, \@ref(eq:chap2VarMoment) can easily be further simplified.
Indeed, we have
    
\[\begin{aligned}
       \text{var} \left( {\bar X} \right) &= \text{var} \left( {\frac{1}{n}\sum\limits_{t = 1}^n {{X_t}} } \right)  \\
       &= \frac{1}{{{n^2}}}{\left[ {\begin{array}{*{20}{c}}
         1& \cdots &1
         \end{array}} \right]_{1 \times n}}\left[ {\begin{array}{*{20}{c}}
           {\gamma \left( 0 \right)}&{\gamma \left( 1 \right)}& \cdots &{\gamma \left( {n - 1} \right)} \\
           {\gamma \left( 1 \right)}&{\gamma \left( 0 \right)}&{}& \vdots  \\
           \vdots &{}& \ddots & \vdots  \\
           {\gamma \left( {n - 1} \right)}& \cdots & \cdots &{\gamma \left( 0 \right)}
           \end{array}} \right]_{n \times n}{\left[ {\begin{array}{*{20}{c}}
             1 \\
             \vdots  \\
             1
             \end{array}} \right]_{n \times 1}}  \\
       &= \frac{1}{{{n^2}}}\left( {n\gamma \left( 0 \right) + 2\left( {n - 1} \right)\gamma \left( 1 \right) + 2\left( {n - 2} \right)\gamma \left( 2 \right) +  \cdots  + 2\gamma \left( {n - 1} \right)} \right)  \\
       &= \frac{1}{n}\sum\limits_{h =  - n}^n {\left( {1 - \frac{{\left| h \right|}}{n}} \right)\gamma \left( h \right)} .  \\
\end{aligned} \]
    
Obviously, when $X_t$ is a white noise process, the above formula reduces to the
usual $\text{var} \left( {\bar X} \right) = \sigma^2_w/n$. In the following example,
we consider the case of an AR(1) process and discuss 
how $\text{var} \left( {\bar X} \right)$ can be obtained or estimated.
    
```{example, label="exactvbootstrap"}
For an AR(1), we have $\gamma(h) = \phi^h \sigma_w^2 \left(1 - \phi^2\right)^{-1}$. Therefore, we obtain (after some computations):
      
\begin{equation}
    \text{var} \left( {\bar X} \right) = \frac{\sigma_w^2 \left( n - 2\phi - n \phi^2 + 2 \phi^{n + 1}\right)}{n^2\left(1-\phi^2\right)\left(1-\phi\right)^2}.
\end{equation}
    
Unfortunately, deriving such an exact formula is often difficult when considering
more complex models. However, asymptotic approximations are often employed to
simplify the calculation. For example, in our case we have
    
\[\mathop {\lim }\limits_{n \to \infty } \; n \text{var} \left( {\bar X} \right) = \frac{\sigma_w^2}{\left(1-\phi\right)^2},\]
    
providing the following approximate formula:
      
\[\text{var} \left( {\bar X} \right) \approx \frac{\sigma_w^2}{n \left(1-\phi\right)^2}.\]
    
Alternatively, simulation methods can also be employed. For example, a possible
strategy would be parametric bootstrap.
```
    
```{theorem, label="parabootstrap", "Parametric Bootstrap"}
1. Simulate a new sample under the postulated model, 
    i.e. $X_t^* \sim F_{\boldsymbol{theta}}{$ (*note:* if $\boldsymbol{theta}$ is unknown it can be
                                   replace by $\hat{\boldsymbol{theta}}$, a suitable estimator).
2. Compute the statistics of interest on the simulated 
    sample $(X_t^*)$.
3. Repeat Steps 1 and 2 $B$ times where $B$ is sufficiently "large" 
    (typically $100 \leq B \leq 10000$).
4. Compute the empirical variance of the statistics of interest based on 
    the $B$ independent replications. 
```
    
In our example, we would consider $(X_t^*)$ to be ${\bar{X}^*}$ and seek to
obtain:
      
\[\hat{\sigma}^2_B = \frac{1}{B-1} \sum_{i = 1}^B \left(\bar{X}^*_i - \bar{X}^* \right)^2, \;\;\; \text{where} \;\;\; \bar{X}^* = \frac{1}{B} \sum_{i=1}^B \bar{X}^*_i,\]
    
where $\bar{X}^*_i$ denotes the value of the mean estimated on the $i$-th 
simulated sample.
    
The figure below generated by the following code compares these three methods
for $n = 10$, $B = 1000$, $\sigma^2 = 1$ and a grid of values for $\phi$ going
from $-0.95$ to $0.95$:
      
      
```{r estimXbar, cache = TRUE, fig.height = 5, fig.width = 7}
# Define sample size
n = 10

# Number of Monte-Carlo replications
B = 5000

# Define grid of values for phi
phi = seq(from = 0.95, to = -0.95, length.out = 30)

# Define result matrix
result = matrix(NA,B,length(phi))

# Start simulation
for (i in seq_along(phi)){
  # Define model
  model = AR1(phi = phi[i], sigma2 = 1)
  
  # Monte-Carlo
  for (j in seq_len(B)){
    # Simulate AR(1)
    Xt = gen_gts(n, model)
    
    # Estimate Xbar
    result[j,i] = mean(Xt)
  }
}

# Estimate variance of Xbar
var.Xbar = apply(result,2,var)

# Compute theoretical variance
var.theo = (n - 2*phi - n*phi^2 + 2*phi^(n+1))/(n^2*(1-phi^2)*(1-phi)^2)

# Compute (approximate) variance
var.approx = 1/(n*(1-phi)^2)

# Compare variance estimations
plot(NA, xlim = c(-1,1), ylim = range(var.approx), log = "y", 
     ylab = expression(paste("var(", bar(X), ")")),
     xlab= expression(phi), cex.lab = 1)
grid()
lines(phi,var.theo, col = "deepskyblue4")
lines(phi, var.Xbar, col = "firebrick3")
lines(phi,var.approx, col = "springgreen4")
legend("topleft",c("Theoretical variance","Bootstrap variance","Approximate variance"), 
       col = c("deepskyblue4","firebrick3","springgreen4"), lty = 1,
       bty = "n",bg = "white", box.col = "white", cex = 1.2)
```
    
It can be observed that the variance of $\bar{X}$ typically increases with 
$\phi$. As expected when $\phi = 0$, we have $\text{var}(\bar{X}) = 1/n$ â€” in 
this case the process is a white noise. Moreover, the bootstrap approach 
appears to approximate well the curve of (\@ref(eq:chap2_exAR1)), while the
asymptotic formula provides a reasonable approximation for $\phi$ being between
-0.5 and 0.5. Naturally, the quality of this approximation would be far better
for a larger sample size (here we consider $n = 10$, which is a little "extreme").
    
### Sample Autocovariance and Autocorrelation Functions
    
A natural estimator of the *autocovariance function* is given by:
      
\[\hat \gamma \left( h \right) = \frac{1}{T}\sum\limits_{t = 1}^{T - h} {\left( {{X_t} - \bar X} \right)\left( {{X_{t + h}} - \bar X} \right)} \]
    
leading to the following "plug-in" estimator of the *autocorrelation function*:
      
\[\hat \rho \left( h \right) = \frac{{\hat \gamma \left( h \right)}}{{\hat \gamma \left( 0 \right)}}.\]
    
A graphical representation of the autocorrelation function is often the first
step for any time series analysis (again assuming the process to be stationary).
Consider the following simulated example:
      
```{r basicACF, cache = TRUE, fig.height = 4.5, fig.width = 7}
# Set seed for reproducibility
set.seed(2241)

# Simulate 100 observation from a Gaussian white noise
Xt = gen_gts(100, WN(sigma2 = 1))

# Compute autocorrelation
acf_Xt = ACF(Xt)

# Plot autocorrelation
plot(acf_Xt, show.ci = FALSE)
```
    
In this example, the true autocorrelation is equal to zero at any 
lag $h \neq 0$, but obviously the estimated autocorrelations are random variables
and are not equal to their true values. It would therefore be useful to have
some knowledge about the variability of the sample autocorrelations (under some
conditions) to assess whether the data comes from a completely random series or
presents some significant correlation at certain lags. The following result
provides an asymptotic solution to this problem:

```{theorem, label="approxnormal"}
If $X_t$ is a strong white noise with finite fourth moment,
then $\hat{\rho}(h)$ is approximately normally distributed with mean $0$ and 
variance $n^{-1}$ for all fixed $h$.
```
    
The proof of this Theorem is given in Appendix \@ref(appendixa).
    
Using this result, we now have an approximate method to assess whether peaks in
the sample autocorrelation are significant by determining whether the observed
peak lies outside the interval $\pm 2/\sqrt{T}$ (i.e. an approximate 95%
confidence interval). Returning to our previous example and adding confidence
bands to the previous graph, we obtain:
      
```{r basicACF2, cache = TRUE, fig.height = 4.5, fig.width = 7}
# Plot autocorrelation with confidence bands 
plot(acf_Xt)
```
    
It can now be observed that most peaks lie within the 
interval $\pm 2/\sqrt{T}$ suggesting that the true data generating process 
is uncorrelated.
    
```{example, label = "acffeatures"}
To illustrate how the autocorrelation function can be used to reveal some
"features" of a time series, we download the level of the Standard & Poor's 500
index, often abbreviated as the S&P 500. This financial index is based on the
market capitalization of 500 large companies having common stock listed on
the New York Stock Exchange or the NASDAQ Stock Market. The graph below 
shows the index level and daily returns from 1990.
```
  

```{r GSPC, cache = TRUE, fig.height = 4, fig.width = 8, warnings = FALSE, message = FALSE}
# Load package
library(quantmod)

# Download S&P index
getSymbols("^GSPC", from="1990-01-01", to = Sys.Date())

# Compute returns
GSPC.ret = ClCl(GSPC)

# Plot index level and returns
par(mfrow = c(1,2))
plot(GSPC, main = " ", ylab = "Index level")
plot(GSPC.ret, main = " ", ylab = "Daily returns")
```

From these graphs, it is clear that the returns are not identically distributed
as the variance seems to vary with time, and clusters with either high or low 
volatility can be observed. These characteristics of financial time series is 
well known and in the Chapter 5, we will discuss how the variance of such 
process can be approximated. Nevertheless, we compute the empirical
autocorrelation function of the S&P 500 return to evaluate the degree 
of "linear" dependence between observations. The graph below presents 
the empirical autocorrelation.

```{r GSPCacf, cache = TRUE, fig.height = 4.5, fig.width = 7, warning = FALSE}
sp500 = na.omit(GSPC.ret)
names(sp500) = paste("S&P 500 (1990-01-01 - ",Sys.Date(),")", sep = "")
plot(ACF(sp500))
```

As expected, the autocorrelation is small but it might be reasonable to believe
that this sequence is not purely uncorrelated.

Unfortunately, Theorem 1 is based on an asymptotic argument and since the
confidence bands constructed are also asymptotic, there are no "exact" tools
that can be used in this case. To study the validity of these results when $n$ is
"small" we performed a simulation. In the latter, we simulated processes
following from a Gaussian white noise and examined the empirical distribution of
$\hat{\rho}(3)$ with different sample sizes (i.e. $n$ is set to 5, 10, 30 and
300). Intuitively, the "quality" of the approximation provided by Theorem 1
should increase with the sample size $n$. The code below performs such a simulation
and compares the empirical distribution of $\sqrt{n} \hat{\rho}(3)$ with a
normal distribution with mean 0 and variance 1 (its asymptotic
distribution), which is depicted using a red line.

```{r simulationACF, cache = TRUE, fig.height = 5.5, fig.width = 7}
# Number of Monte Carlo replications
B = 10000

# Define considered lag
h = 3

# Sample size considered
N = c(5, 10, 30, 300)

# Initialisation
result = matrix(NA,B,length(N))

# Set seed
set.seed(1)

# Start Monte Carlo
for (i in seq_len(B)){
  for (j in seq_along(N)){
    # Simluate process
    Xt = rnorm(N[j])
    
    # Save autocorrelation at lag h
    result[i,j] = acf(Xt, plot = FALSE)$acf[h+1]
  }
}

# Plot results
par(mfrow = c(2,length(N)/2))
for (i in seq_along(N)){
  # Estimated empirical distribution
  hist(sqrt(N[i])*result[,i], col = "royalblue1", 
       main = paste("Sample size n =",N[i]), probability = TRUE,
       xlim = c(-4,4), xlab = " ")
  
  # Asymptotic distribution
  xx = seq(from = -10, to = 10, length.out = 10^3)
  yy = dnorm(xx,0,1)
  lines(xx,yy, col = "red", lwd = 2)
}
```

As expected, it can clearly be observed that the asymptotic approximation is
quite poor when $n = 5$ but as the sample size increases the approximation
improves and is very close when, for example, $n = 300$. This simulation could
suggest that Theorem 1 provides a relatively "close" approximation of the
distribution of $\hat{\rho}(h)$.

### Robustness Issues

<!-- Rob I am sure you would be great to extent this section! I add a small simulation as an example -->
  
The data generating process delivers a theoretical autocorrelation
(autocovariance) function that, as explained in the previous section,
can then be estimated through the sample autocorrelation (autocovariance)
functions. However, in practice, the sample is often issued from a data 
generating process that is "close" to the true one, meaning that the sample
suffers from some form of small contamination. This contamination is typically
represented by a small amount of extreme observations that are called "outliers"
that come from a process that is different from the true data generating process.

The fact that the sample can suffer from outliers implies that the standard
estimation of the autocorrelation (autocovariance) functions through the sample
functions could be highly biased. The standard estimators presented in the
previous section are therefore not "robust" and can behave badly when the sample
suffers from contamination. To illustrate this limitation of a classical estimator,
we consider the following two processes:
  
\[ 
    \begin{aligned}
    X_t &= \phi X_{t-1} + W_t, \;\;\; W_t \sim \mathcal{N}(0,\sigma_w^2),\\
    Y_t &= \begin{cases}
    X_t       & \quad \text{with probability } 1 - \epsilon\\
    U_t  & \quad \text{with probability } \epsilon\\
    \end{cases}, \;\;\; U_t \sim \mathcal{N}(0,\sigma_u^2),
    \end{aligned}
\] 

when $\epsilon$ is "small" and $\sigma_u^2 \gg \sigma_w^2$, the process $(Y_t)$
can be interpreted as a "contaminated" version of $(X_t)$. The figure below
represents one relalization of the processes $(X_t)$ and $(Y_t)$ using the 
following setting: $n = 100$, $\sigma_u^2 = 10$, $\phi = 0,5$, $\sigma_w^2 = 1$ as 
well as $\alpha = 0.05$.

```{r XtYt, cache = TRUE, fig.height = 8, fig.width = 7}
```

Next, we consider a simulated example to highlight how the performance of a
"classical" autocorrelation can deteriorate if the sample is contaminated (i.e.
what is the impact of using $Y_t$ instead of $X_t$, the "uncontaminated" 
process). In this simulation, we will use the setting presented above and
consider $B = 10^3$ bootstrap replications.

```{r simulationRobust, cache = TRUE, fig.height = 5.5, fig.width = 7}
```

The boxplots in each figure show how the standard autocorrelation estimator is
centered around the true value (red line) when the sample is not 
contaminated (left boxplot) while it is considerably biased when the sample is
contaminated (right boxplot), especially at the smallest lags. Indeed, it can 
be seen how the boxplots under contamination are often close to zero indicating 
that it does not detect much dependence in the data although it should. This is 
a known result in robustness, more specifically that outliers in the data can 
break the dependence structure and make it more difficult for the latter to be
detected.

In order to limit this problem, different robust estimators exist for time
series problems which are designed to reduce contamination during 
the estimation procedure. Among these estimators, there are a few that estimate the
autocorrelation (autocovariance) functions in a robust manner. One of these 
estimators is provided in the ``robacf()`` function in the "robcor" package. 
The following simulated example shows how it limits bias from contamination. 
Unlike in the previous simulation, we shall only consider data issued 
from the contaminated model, $Y_t$, and compare the performance of two 
estimators (i.e. classical and robust autocorrelation estimators):
  
```{r simulationRobust2, cache = TRUE, fig.height = 5.5, fig.width = 7}
```

The robust estimator remains close to the true value represented by the red line
in the boxplots as opposed to the standard estimator. It can also be observed 
that to reduce the bias induced by contamination in the sample, robust
estimators pay a certain price in terms of efficiency as highlighted by the
boxplots that show more variability compared to those of the standard estimator.
To assess how much is "lost" by the robust estimator compared to the classical
one in terms of efficiency, we consider one last simulation where we examine 
the performance of two estimators on data issued from the uncontaminated model,
i.e. $(X_t)$. Therefore, the only difference between this simulation and the 
previous one is the value of $\alpha$ set equal to $0$; the code shall thus be omitted
and the results are depicted below:
  
```{r simulationRobust3, cache = TRUE, echo = FALSE, fig.height = 5.5, fig.width = 7}
# TO DO
```

It can be observed that both estimators provide extremely similar results,
although the robust estimator is slightly more variable.

Next, we consider the issue of robustness on the real data set coming from the
domain of hydrology presented in Section \@ref(eda). This data concerns monthly
precipitation (in mm) over a certain period of time (1907 to 1972). Let us 
compare the standard and robust estimators of the autocorrelation functions:
  
```{r hydro_ACF, cache = TRUE, fig.height = 4, fig.width = 7}
# TO DO
```

It can be seen that, under certain assumptions (e.g. linear dependence), the 
standard estimator does not detect any significant autocorrelation between lags
since the estimations all lie within the asymptotic confidence intervals. However,
many of the robust estimations lie outside these confidence intervals at different 
lags indicating that there could be dependence within the data. If one were only to
rely on the standard estimator in this case, there may be erroneous conclusions
drawn on this data. Robustness issues therefore need to be considered for any 
time series analysis, not only when estimating the 
autocorrelation (autocovariance) functions.

Finally, we return to S&P 500 returns and compare the classical and robust
autocorrelation estimators, which are presented in the figure below.

```{r GSPCracf, cache = TRUE, fig.height = 4, fig.width = 7}
# TO DO
```

It can be observed that both estimators are very similar. Nevertheless, some
small discrepancies can be observed. In particular, the robust estimators seem
to indicate an absence of linear dependence while a slightly different
interpretation might be achieved with the classical estimator.


### Sample Cross-Covariance and Cross-Correlation Functions

A natural estimator of the *cross-covariance function* is given by:
  
  \[{{\hat \gamma }_{XY}}\left( h \right) = \frac{1}{T}\sum\limits_{t = 1}^{T - h} {\left( {{X_{t + h}} - \bar X} \right)\left( {{Y_t} - \bar Y} \right)} \]

With this in mind, the "plug-in" estimator for the *cross-correlation function*
  follows:
  
  \[{{\hat \rho }_{XY}}\left( h \right) = \frac{{{{\hat \gamma }_{XY}}\left( h \right)}}{{\sqrt {{{\hat \gamma }_X}\left( 0 \right)} \sqrt {{{\hat \gamma }_Y}\left( 0 \right)} }}\]

Both of the above estimators are again only symmetric under the above index
and lag transformation.
